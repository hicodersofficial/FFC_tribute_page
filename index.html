                Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial
                nationalist, and political ethicist, who employed nonviolent
                resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence
                from British rule, and in turn inspired movements for civil rights and
                freedom across the world.
